# School District Analysis
Analyzing a school district's data
## Overview of the Project
The goal of this project was to analyze the school district's data regarding test scores, school size, school type, and school budget. The analysis was done on all the data for the school district, but then was repeated to exclude the test scores of 9th graders from Thomas High School because of a cheating issue.
## Results
After repeating the district analysis and excluding the 9th grade test scores from Thomas High School, the original results were impacted. Details of the impacts are listed here. 
* District Summary
The original district summary is very slightly effected by the score removal from Thomas High School. 
* School Summary
The individual school summaries are the same for every school except Thomas High School. The scores are slightly lower after the removal of the ninth grade scores, though they are simlar. 
* Thomas High School Ranking
Because the change in scores for Thomas High School is so small, it retains its spot as number 2 in the ranking of the top five schools based on test score performance. 
* Ninth grade scores
  * Math and reading scores by grade
  * Scores by school spending
  * Scores by school size
  * Scores by school type
## Summary
There is a statement summarizing four major changes to the school district analysis after reading and math scores have been replaced (5 pt).
In summary, the main four changes to the school district analysis are: 
* The school district summary is slightly different 
* The average scores for Thomas High School are slightly lower, as is its percentage of students passing reading and math
